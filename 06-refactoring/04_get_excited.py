"""
`get_excited` is a function that takes a piece of text and returns it with all
of the full stops (.) replaced by exclamation marks (!).

Refactor get_excited to use a string method. All of this code can be rewritten
in just one line with one string method...

If you run pytest on this file, all tests should pass.
